# Machine Learning Toolkit

This is a general project to collate Machine Learning work, serving as a practical implementation reference.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms and utilities, built from scratch for educational purposes.

## Project Structure

### ml-checklist

Collection of functions designed to help with initial data preparation and model setup. These utilities highlight common considerations in ML workflows:
- Data validation
- Feature preprocessing
- Model evaluation setup

### model-building

Collection of hand-built machine learning models implemented from scratch.

#### Implemented Models:
- âœ… Linear Regression
  - With L1 (Lasso) regularization
  - With L2 (Ridge) regularization
- âœ… Logistic Regression
  - Sigmoid activation function
  - Log loss cost function implementation


#### In Progress:

- ðŸš§ Neural Networks
  - Simple feedforward network
  - Backpropagation for gradient descent


#### To Do:
- Restructure model-building to be more modular
- Add more tests
- Add more documentation
- Add more examples

- ðŸš§ Generating Eigenvectors
  - Visualizing Eigenvectors of a covariance matrix
